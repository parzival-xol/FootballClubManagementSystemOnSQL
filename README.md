# FootballClubManagementSystemOnSQL

This solo university project is a database designed to manage football club operations. It stores detailed information on footballers (e.g., name, ID, salary, bonuses, injuries) and other personnel, including managers, scouts, physiotherapists, technical directors, and the president.  

The system establishes relationships between entities and showcases advanced SQL features like views and subqueries for efficient and structured data management.
