# FootballClubManagementSystemOnSQL
It's a database on SQl that I did for my university project. Here you can store Footballer's details such as Name, Unique ID, Salary, Bonus Injuries etc. Similarly you can store Managers, Scouts, Physiotherapist, Techinical Directors and President's Data. There is connection between these entity. I also displayed how to create view, subqueries.
